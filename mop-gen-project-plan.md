# MOP Generation Web Application - Project Plan

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Project Description
The MOP Generation Web Application is an on-premises solution for automatically generating Methods of Procedure documents for network operations. The system will process PDF documents containing network specifications, leverage the Cognee RAG system for intelligent document processing, and generate detailed MOPs with commands, verification steps, and rollback procedures.

### 1.2 Project Objectives
- Create a secure, on-premises web application for MOP generation
- Integrate with the existing Cognee RAG system
- Provide a user-friendly interface for document upload and MOP management
- Implement collaborative review workflows
- Support multiple export formats
- Ensure comprehensive audit logging and version control

### 1.3 Key Constraints
- Small development team (3 developers)
- On-premises deployment with strict security requirements
- Integration with existing Cognee RAG system

## 2. Team Structure and Responsibilities

With a small team of 3 developers, we'll need a flexible approach where each team member takes on multiple roles:

    subgraph "Team Structure"
        Dev1[Developer 1<br>Lead Developer<br>Backend Specialist]
        Dev2[Developer 2<br>Frontend Specialist<br>UI/UX Design]
        Dev3[Developer 3<br>DevOps<br>QA & Testing]
    end
    
    Dev1 --- BackendTasks[Backend Services<br>API Development<br>Database Design]
    Dev2 --- FrontendTasks[Frontend Development<br>UI Components<br>User Experience]
    Dev3 --- DevOpsTasks[Infrastructure<br>CI/CD Pipeline<br>Testing Automation]
    
    Dev1 -.-> SharedTasks[Shared Responsibilities<br>Code Reviews<br>Documentation<br>Testing]
    Dev2 -.-> SharedTasks
    Dev3 -.-> SharedTasks
```

### 2.1 Role Rotation
To prevent knowledge silos and ensure project continuity:
- Weekly knowledge sharing sessions
- Cross-training on critical components
- Documentation of all development decisions

## 3. Project Phases and Timeline

Given the complexity and small team size, we recommend a 15-month timeline divided into 6 phases:

```mermaid
